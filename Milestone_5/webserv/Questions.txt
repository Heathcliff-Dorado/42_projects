From SocketServer.cpp
Line 139
struct sockaddr_storage their_addr; // struct to store client's address information

I assume here we are creating their_addr, when does it get a value?



Questions on the configuration file
-Which variables do we need?
-Which variables can we set a default value for?
-How strict is the formatting of the config_file (i.e. should we keep NGINX formatting, can we make it more straightforward for parsing)
